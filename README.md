Uses linear Regression to predict house prices with the help of kaggle dataset

Here I used a Kaggle dataset of house prices in banglore.india

* Load CSV files
* Checked for non numerical data
* Remove non significant colunms
* Drop the naN rows
* Feature engineered to get more useful features for training
* replaced ranges of values with their average
* Use one hot encoding for non numerical columns

## Algorithm --> Linear Regression

Libraries - Numpy | Pandas | SKlearn | Matplotlib
